# AnkiDecks


## What is this project
This is the home of a collaborative project aimed at building common, open Anki decks, intended for self study in preparation for FAA aviation exams. 

If you are a student, you are free to import these decks into your Anki collection and use them to study as much as you feel like, free of charge. All feedback is welcome as the source material is dynamically changing, and so is the DPE's focus. 
In addition to that, mistakes, accidental omissions and unintented lapses of coverage are always possible.

The initial focus will be mostly on oral exams (e.g., Private Pilot Airplane Singe Engine Land oral exam, Commercial Pilot Airplane Singe Engine Land, Airplane Single-Engine Sea add-on rating, Airplane Multi-Engine Land rating, etc.).

This project intends to minimize overlap with existing, commercially available, preparation software and material aimed at the (written) knowledge test.  

## What is Anki
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced repetition flashcard study software. 
It is extremely effective for self study of memorization-intensive material, like the material required to pass FAA Oral exams is.

The most important feature for our purposes is Anki's ability to remember what questions you know well and what questions need more study.
Specifically, at any point in time, Anki maintains accurate bookeeping on each question, tracking whether you have never seen it (new material), you have seen it but you made recent mistakes on it (you need to practice it more) or it's well mastered and you don't need to practice it for a while.

This feature is crucial for making the best use of your time, i.e., focusing on the topics that need more study. 

With Anki you can study on your computer, on your phone or on your tablet and synchronize your progress across devices.
The iOS app is available at a charge (but well worth the price), but desktop apps for Windows or MacOS, and the Android smartphone app, are available for free.

## Copyright Claims

The author commits to making a honest effort to 
- avoid use any material copyrighted by others in these decks,
- rejecting contributions that contain material copyrighted by others,
- promptly removing all material that is copyrighted or property of others and was accidentally present in the decks.

Mistakes are always possible, and so is similarity to commercially available material, given the fact that the source origin (FAA Handbooks and Manuals) is common.
